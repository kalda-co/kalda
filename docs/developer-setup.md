# Developer setup

Read the commands carefully before running them! Some are only for Ubuntu Linux, some are only for Apple OSX!

## Setup the Postgresql database

Install the Postgresql database though a means of your chosing. OSX
developers may want to use `brew`, Ubuntu Linux developers may want to use
`apt`. 

```sh
# Ubuntu Linux
sudo apt install postgresql
# Apple OSX
brew install postgres
```

Ensure there is a Postgresql user called `postgres` with the password
`postgres`.

```sh
# On Ubuntu Linux
sudo -u postgres psql 
\password postgres
# Now type in the password `postgres`
```

## Clone the project locally

You will need to have created an SSH key and added it to your GitHub account
before cloning the repo. See the [GitHub documentation][gh-ssh] for instructions.

[gh-ssh]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

```sh
cd to/directory/where/you/keep/your/projects
git clone git@github.com:kalda-co/kalda.git
cd kalda
```


## Set up Elixir, Erlang, and NodeJS 

We use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to install and manage
programming languages versions.

Install the deps

```sh
# Ubuntu Linux
sudo apt install curl git
# Apple OSX
brew install coreutils curl git
```

Install asdf.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.8.0
```

Add the asdf config to your shell.

- If you use bash add `. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh` to your `~/.bashrc`
- If you use fish add `source ~/.asdf/asdf.fish` to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
- If you use zsh add `. ~/.asdf/asdf.sh` to your `~/.zshrc`

Now restart your shell so the config takes effect. Be sure to `cd` back to
the Kalda project directory.

Add the language plugins and their deps

```sh
asdf plugin add erlang
# Ubuntu Linux
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf m4 libncurses5-dev libpng-dev libssh-dev unixodbc-dev xsltproc fop libxml2-utils libncurses-dev
# Apple OSX
brew install autoconf wxmac
```

```sh
asdf plugin add elixir
```

```sh
asdf plugin add nodejs
bash -c '${ASDF_DATA_DIR:=$HOME/.asdf}/plugins/nodejs/bin/import-release-team-keyring'
```

Install Elixir, Erlang, and NodeJS using asdf. 

This compiles Erlang from scratch and will take a long time, so this is a
good time for a tea break â˜•

```sh
asdf install
```

## Install application deps

```sh
mix deps.get
cd assets && npm install && cd ..
```

## Setup the Kalda database

```sh
mix ecto.setup
```

## Run the app locally

```sh
mix phx.server
```
Now you can visit the application running locally by going to
<http://localhost:4000> in your browser. 

Any front-end changes will be automatically synced with the browser, no need
to hit refresh.

You're now ready to developer Kalda!
