# Developer setup

Read the commands carefully before running them! Some are only for Ubuntu Linux, some are only for Apple OSX!

## Configure Git on your machine

For first time git users there is a need to do some set up to get their git account configured and authenticated with github.

You can follow the instructions [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git)

## Setup the Postgresql database

Install the Postgresql database though a means of your chosing. OSX
developers may want to use `brew`, Ubuntu Linux developers may want to use
`apt`.

```sh
# Ubuntu Linux
sudo apt install postgresql
# Apple OSX
brew install postgres
```

#### On OSX

```sh
# Start postgres
brew services start postgresql

# Create postgres user with password postgres
createuser --username=$USER --superuser --pwprompt postgres
```


#### On Debian/Ubuntu Linux

Set the postgres user's username to postgres

```sh
# On Ubuntu Linux
sudo -u postgres psql
\password postgres
# Now type in the password `postgres`
```

## Clone the project locally

You will need to have created an SSH key and added it to your GitHub account
before cloning the repo. See the [GitHub documentation][gh-ssh] for instructions.

[gh-ssh]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

```sh
cd to/directory/where/you/keep/your/projects
git clone git@github.com:kalda-co/kalda.git
cd kalda
```

## Get the developer secrets

There are some values (API keys, etc) that we use in dev but cannot be kept
in the repo because they are secret or sensitive. Ask a member of the dev team
for a copy and then place this file at `config/dev_secrets.exs` in the cloned
folder.

## Set up Elixir, Erlang, and NodeJS (and verion management generally with ASDF)

We use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to install and manage
programming languages versions.

Install the deps

```sh
# Ubuntu Linux
sudo apt install curl git
# Apple OSX
brew install coreutils curl git
```

## Install asdf.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.8.0
```

Add the asdf config to your shell.

- If you use bash add `. $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh` to your `~/.bashrc`
- If you use fish add `source ~/.asdf/asdf.fish` to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
- If you use zsh add `. ~/.asdf/asdf.sh` to your `~/.zshrc`

Now restart your shell so the config takes effect. Be sure to `cd` back to
the Kalda project directory.

Add the language plugins and their deps. If you have any problems with these see the READMEs of the plugins on GitHub for installation instructions.

```sh
asdf plugin-add erlang
# Ubuntu Linux
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf m4 libncurses5-dev libpng-dev libssh-dev unixodbc-dev xsltproc libxml2-utils libncurses-dev
# Apple OSX
brew install autoconf wxmac
```

```sh
asdf plugin-add elixir
```

```sh
asdf plugin-add nodejs
```

Install Elixir, Erlang, and NodeJS using asdf.

This compiles Erlang from scratch and will take up to tens of minutes, so
this is a good time for a tea break â˜•

```sh
asdf install
```

## Install application deps

```sh
mix deps.get
npm install
```

## Setup the Kalda database

```sh
mix ecto.setup
```

## Run the app locally

```sh
npm start
```

Now you can visit the application running locally by going to
<http://localhost:4000> in your browser.

Any front-end changes will be automatically synced with the browser, no need
to hit refresh.

You're now ready to developer Kalda!
