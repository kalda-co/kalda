  ## Is group therapy as good as one-to-one therapy?
  For many conditions, group therapy is actually BETTER than one to one therapy. :mind-blown:
  Yeah I know, we didnt believe it either at first. [Below is some of the science to back that up](link) ,but don't forget, everyone is different and YMMV. 
  If one to one works best for you then that is totally ok. That's why Kalda offers free trials for our group therapy! Even if it's not for you, we also have a community-only option where you can get help and support and tools for your existing network, find a support network, or join one of our villages to support you on your one-to-one therapy journey. 
  Kalda can even help you find a one-to-one therapist who's LGBTQIA+/SEX+/alt/poly/Neuro-nontypical etc. Someone who ~gets~ your flavour of unique.

  ## Tip from Al, Kalda CTO and Founder (they/them)
  The bisexual in me thinks why have it one way when you can have it both ways so my top tip for quarantimes is most definitely to stay busy! Having something as awesome as Kalda to work on is really helping me feel like I have purpose and keeps my mind off the news, which I check as little as once a week if possible. But one of my partners is out of work due to the pandemic and she has found her purpose making amazing popup cards and cross-stitch patches for frineds and family which she then posts, spreading SO much joy. (Image?)
  But back to having both, as well as working my fabulous butt of during the week I am making sure to have a real chill time at the weekends. A few calls, some bedroom dancing and some full on duvet-days. Zero pressure to do anything AND given that there is a pandemic on, zero pressure to even go anywhere. When you have things to do for some of the week, being a duvet-slug in your downtimes feels GREAT not guilty like it used to.
