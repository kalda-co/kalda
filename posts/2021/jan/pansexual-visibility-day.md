# What does Pansexual mean? 

Pansexuality is a sexual, romantic or emotional attraction to people regardless of their sex or gender identity. 
It can be argued that pansexuality is a branch of bisexuality, but it has been widely accepted as a sexual identity in its own right. 

The literal meaning of prefix pan- comes from the ancient Greek word meaning “all” or “every”. There is some similarity between the term pansexual and the term omnisexual, as the prefix eytmology is similar, as the ancient greek word omni- has a similar meaning. 

In a literal sense, the term is more inclusive when compared to the term bisexual, which comes from the Greek word meaning two. It therefore includes people who are not part of the gender binary, such as transgender people or intersex people. 

# Pansexual Visibility Day 

May 24th of every year is Pansexual Visibility Day, and we believe that it is important to spread awareness about the existence of pansexuals everywhere. 

# Why do we do this? 
There is an unfortunate amount of erasure that happens when it comes to pansexual people, and the point of visibility days like these are to promote awareness and dispell the notion thatansexual people don’t exist. 

We have compiled a list of famous people who are pansexual, who you may not have known about:

    “I identify publicly as bisexual. I would also use the word pansexual to describe my sexuality. The thing is I use the word bisexual just because I feel like for people who don’t necessarily know that vocabulary…it’s easier to say I’m bi.”

<blockquote style="margin-left:40px; color:black;">
As I've said before, in the UK as a kid, culture had only *just* started to begrudgingly accept bisexuals were real. I didn't *know* about the actual scope of sexuality and gender. 
So I just went with boy, even thought it never quite felt right.

I really enjoy visibility days, and their purpose is to highlight the existence of, and support for, marginalized groups. Pansexuals certainly fall into this category, and we wish all of our pansexual friends a wonderful day! 

Even if it isn’t Pansexual Visibility Day.
