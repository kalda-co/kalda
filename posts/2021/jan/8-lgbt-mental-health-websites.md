When our mental health is low, we can feel isolated and trapped. Finding help can feel impossible. This is why we have put together a list of LGBTQIA+ mental health websites whose purpose is to provide support. Some of these sites will be direct lines to therapists, other ones will be more general. 

It’s important to remember that whatever it is that you’re going through, you are not alone, and there are wonderful people who want to help you. 

Here are our top eight picks for LGBTQ Therapy websites, in no particular order. 

## Pride Counseling
This is a service which is provided through an online chat service, and all of their counsellors are highly trained experts in their respective fields, as well as being either members of the LGBTQ community or experts in this area. 
There are a wide variety of experts available who will ensure that your needs are met, everything from LGBTQ+ specific issues, identity, bereavement and other issues.

## Pink Therapy
This website is a directory of counsellors who work exclusively with clients who are diverse in their gender or sexuality. 
> “I have used Pink Therapy in the past to find a therapist, and the person I contacted was excellent, if a bit expensive. The quality of the service is excellent and the diversity of practitioners is very high as well.” 
Boris, Kalda Digital Marketing Assistant

## MindOut
MindOut is an organisation that specialises in providing mental health support for LGBTQ people, offering a wide variety of services. On their website they offer a huge amount of different options, from peer support and group options to recommendations for therapists. This is an excellent resource for anyone who feels that they need support from a well-funded and diverse service.

## The LGBT Foundation
This website is a truly huge hub of information, events, support and ways that you can help others as well as yourself. They are another excellent resource for those who are looking for a mixed approach to mental health support. Not only offering mental health support, the large number of campaigns they run to help the most vulnerable in our society is truly breathtaking.

## The Be You Project
This is an excellent resource for younger people and those around them. There is a section dedicated to parents and friends of LGBTQ people, as well as pointing towards excellent resources where the person in question can get support. They also have an excellent safeguarding feature, the “quick exit” button, which closes the page and exists straight to google. This is an excellent feature, which I believe should be on more websites.

## Stonewall UK
Stonewall is a website that every LGBTQIA+ person should be aware of, they are an excellent resource for everything from the latest news in the community, to amazing help and advice. Not only this, they are one of the most prominent political pressure groups for LGBTQIA+ rights in the UK. They are an amazing organisation ran by dedicated and compassionate people.

## Mermaids UK
Mermaids are another incredible charity which everyone should be aware of. Their mission is to provide resources for children and young people experiencing gender dysphoria. Not only this, they provide help for the families of the children experiencing this. This is a truly wonderful organisation that I absolutely adore.
