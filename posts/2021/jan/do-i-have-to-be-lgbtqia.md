> I don't identify as LGBTQIA+, can I use Kalda?

_A yes, you can, because a Kaldan who identfies as LGBTQIA+ has reccommended you anbd wants you in their community or more specifically in theor support network._

### kelda is for people who identify as LGBTQIA plus, and their communities and support networks.

> Isn't that everyone?

_It might be one day. It could be_

### Why, then is Kalda not just for everyone?

If you don't identify as LGBTQIA plus, and you don't have anyone that does in your network, then Canada isn't for you. Although we really hope that soon there will be a version of Canada that is for you. But the reason that Canada isn't for you right now, is because Kalda is about community, connection, support vulnerability and safety. Because Kalda is a place where our users can get group therapy.

### What is it about Group Therapy?

There is a way to make sure group therapy is us most successful, just as successful, and sometimes far more successful than one to one therapy. And it is about the make-up of the group. Group therapy has been shown scientifically shown to be most successful when the group who's going undergoing group therapy have a shared identity or a shared purpose (or both!).

### What is it about Groups?

Google did a study about what makes their teams, the most productive best teams. I know that sounds like a bit of a tangent but hear me out. What they discovered is it's not about the age of the people in the teams, and it's not about if they share the same hobbies, and it's not even about how many years of experience they have, or the boss has. The teams that performed the best at the Google headquarters are the teams that felt it was safe space to be heard. And to make mistakes.
And in a way that's also what Kalda is about, because we know that teams groups and therapy, are all better when people feel safe. And in order to feel safe, especially with a bunch of strangers. The best way to do that is to make sure that the group has a shared identity or a shared purpose, or both. That's why Kalda is FOR the LGBTQIA plus community at the moment. And it always will be.

### I do not identify as LGBTQIA+ but I have been invited to join Kalda.

That's OK!!! So Kalda is for the LGBTQIA+ community but if someone in that community wants you in theor support network and in their community then you're in! That's because by inviting you they have vouched for you. They've said that you are important to theor mental health journey and theor community nad theor suppport network. And that means that YOUR mental health is important to them, and so it is important to US. All we ask is that you make SURE that if you ever want to invite someone who does not identify as LGBTQIA+ to the platform that you understand that the purpose of the group is to create a supportive community for people who identify as LGBTQIA+ and htat if they are willing to contribute to that, and they are part of your support network, then they are welcome too. But at the same time it is important to remind everyone that this is a place designed for LGBTQIA+ people. If that isn't you, then theis space is not designed for you. That's ok, if you are an ally you understand that marginalised communities need a space that is designed for them. You get it, you support that, and that is why youre here.

<!-- That's what makes Canada so powerful, and makes Calvin's therapeutic journey, more likely to succeed.  -->
 <!-- that are for different communities. We know that if a member of the community. Once you encounter. They know that you are committed to supporting them in every step of their mental health journey, you're committed to contributing to the safe space that makes kaldur so powerful, and helps them to grow and heal, you're committed to supporting them and being a part of their support network. And that's why the caldon member has invited you. Even if you don't identify as LGBTQIA plus yourself, and that's okay. -->

### Ok, I don't think that Kalda is for me, but that doesn't seem fair.

Our LONG TEMM mission is to improve the mental wellbeing of the WORLD. To create supportive communities and connect people to support networks all over the world. If everyone ends up with a place like Kalda, we will all be connected, supporting each other on our journeys through life. IMAGINE!!! That will mean no more poverty, unwanted children, litter, or rainy days!!! (ok, maybenot that last one). BUT we are few. Kalda is the first step towards that, so if it isn't for you YET please don't despair, support what we are doing anyway and we will get to you I PRTOMISE <3

# But what about LGBTQIA plus people who aren't out, or even don't have any friends. Surely, those are the people that might need counter the most???

Absolutely. Great question. Thank you for your indignation there you are SPOT ON!!!
We are here for those people. We hear those people. If you are those people we ARE here for you.
Just get in touch. Everyone who joined us at the beginning of Canada got a call from our team. And we talked them through joining, and what their goals were and what our process was, and we'd be delighted to do the same for you. And that's how we'll know that you belong and kaldur, even if someone who isn't already in Kalda didn't recommend you. That's how we keep the existing community safe but we also help keep YOU safe by connecting you to them if this is you.

We do not want to exclude the people in the LGBTQIA plus community who don't have a support network or a community of their own, or just don't know anyone else yet, because if that is you, you will, because you belong. And we want to help you get there.

### Ok, good for the people who hear about it, what about the rest?

We also work in partnership with charities like Stonewall and mermaids. And those charities that specifically are designed to help members of the LGBTQIA plus community when they need mental health and other kinds of support, and they can recommend people who use their services directly to us as well. And in fact, they can even get it for free. So that might be a route to go down. If you don't feel like you can contact us directly. We are woking hard to make sure that anyone in the LGBTQIA+ community, who needs Kalda, who kalda could help, will find us. SO if you are a place like Stonewall or Mermaids, and your mission is to help those people GET IN TOUCH because we will shower you in sugarlumps. (Or probably just help you get Kalda to the people who need it)

### How do I join Kalda?

All you need to do is ask a friend to recommend you and onboard you to the kaldur journey. That will take you through our onboarding video, and our chat guide or give you the guide version, and they'll let you know what it's all about and let you decide together. If Caldas is right for you. And if you are committed to contributing and can maintaining the safe space that kaldur is.
