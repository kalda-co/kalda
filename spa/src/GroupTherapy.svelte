    <h1>About the sessions</h1>
    <p>
      Kalda group sessions takes place every week over Zoom. The Kalda coach
      gives a guided meditation to the group. Then, we break out into small
      groups to do sharing circles. There may be up to 100 participants at a
      Kalda group therapy session.

    <h1>How should I prepare?</h1>
    <p>
      Find a private space where you won’t be disturbed. Make sure you are able
      to access Zoom from the device that you’re on. There is no need to book.
      As well as being able to connect from your dashboard, we’ll also email you
      a Zoom link.

    <h1>Can I be anonymous?</h1>
    <p>
      Because we connect to the session over Zoom, to be anonymous you’ll need
      to change your Zoom display name. If you feel more comfortable with your
      camera off that’s fine. We do recommend that people keep their camera on,
      so that participants can get a sense of connection.

    <p>
      You will be welcomed to the session and to the meditation. The Kalda coach
      will lead the group in a short guided meditation. There will be an
      opportunity to share reflection on the meditation, for those who feel
      comfortable doing so. We will end on intention setting for the week.

    <p>
      All activities are invitational, you are free to share as much as you feel
      comfortable and participate to the level that you feel comfortable. We
      encourage you to have your camera on for the safety of the group.
