    <h1>What is group therapy?</h1>
    <p>
      Kalda group therapy takes place every week over Zoom. The Kalda coach
      gives a guided meditation to the group. Then, we break out into small
      groups to do sharing circles. There may be up to 100 participants at a
      Kalda group therapy session.

    <h1>How should I prepare?</h1>
    <p>
      Find a private space where you won’t be disturbed. Make sure you are able
      to access Zoom from the device that you’re on. There is no need to book.
      As well as being able to connect from your dashboard, we’ll also email you
      a Zoom link.

    <h1>Can I be anonymous?</h1>
    <p>
      Because we connect to the session over Zoom, to be anonymous you’ll need
      to change your Zoom display name. If you feel more comfortable with your
      camera off that’s fine. We do recommend that people keep their camera on,
      so that participants can get a sense of connection.

    <h1>What is the science behind it?</h1>
    <p>
      Many studies have shown that group therapy is as effective, if not more
      effective than individual therapy. The act of sharing and listening to
      others experiences is cathartic. Kalda groups are for the LGBTQIA+
      community, this sense of shared identity creates a safe and supportive
      space.
